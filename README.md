In this project, I analyzed citizen-scientist observation data from Project FeederWatch to determine songbird migration and participant submission patterns in Tennessee. The technology and skills employed to achieve this goal include: Tableau and Microsoft Excel.

It uses data for Tennessee for winter observations submitted from November 2010 to April 2021.

All data was retrieved from https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/, which holds records of all submitted observations. Datasets are available as .CSV files and range in size from 380 MB - 1.3 GB.

The Project Feederwatch Data Dictionary is also available at https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/.
